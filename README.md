# Experimentation  

## Task 3.1  
### Streaming of the word "Brexit" on Twitter 
- It's a word massively used in the last months, so it's interesting for further analysis. We got a lot of tweets in a few minutes.

## Task 3.2
### 1. Print the tweets from the streaming json file in real time


### 2. Tokenize each tweet in order to extract the words

### 3. Get the result of the common words without preprocessing

### 4. Drop some stop words 
- Frequent words according to the dictionary and punctuations according to the library string

### 5. Drop some new stop words and normalize the words as lowercase
- Some punctuations weren't taken into account and we have used the lowercase option of preprocess function to normalize words in order to have better insights

### 6. Only Hashtags

### 7. Without Hashtags or Mentions

### 8. Frequents words, frequents hastags, frequent tokens without mentions nor hashtags
